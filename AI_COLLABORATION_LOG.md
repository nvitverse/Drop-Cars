### Antigravity Pass: Missing Screens, 360dp Layout Overhaul, Backend All-Inclusive Extra KM + GST Billing (2026-10-07) - branch `feat/missing-screens`
- **Backend: All-Inclusive Extra KM + 5% GST Billing at Trip Close** (`backend/app/crud/end_records.py`):
  - When closing an All-Inclusive booking (`is_all_inclusive: True` & `customer_all_inclusive_includes_gst: True`), extra distance driven beyond the package limit is billed to customer as `extra_km_bill = extra_km * extra_km_rate` plus 5% GST on extra distance (`extra_km_gst = round(extra_km_bill * 0.05, 2)`).
  - Driver payout (`driver_net`, `driver_profit`) is strictly preserved as per the agreed package/standard tariff.
  - Added comprehensive test suite `backend/tests/test_all_inclusive_extra_km_gst.py`. Full pytest suite: **219 passed, 0 failed**.
- **Admin App: Built Missing Screens** (matched to Drop Cars Admin design system, theme tokens, cards, pull-to-refresh, empty & error states, dark mode, 360dp narrow width):
  1. `admin-panel/app/workers-payroll.tsx` (Settings > Team): 1-tap bulk daily attendance, worker management modal, advances tracker, petty cashbook ledger, and monthly worker payroll calculation.
  2. `admin-panel/app/tax-reports.tsx` (Settings > Accounts, permission `tax_accounts` or Owner): GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, Section 9(5) ECO tax reports, tax invoice lists, credit note modal, driver settlement generator & finalizer, company tax profile editor.
  3. `admin-panel/app/driver-tours.tsx` (Settings > Operations): Active tours live summary, tour ledger & settlement modal, expense verification, own-fleet return trip matches, autopilot config manager, customer review queue, and CRM broadcast sender.
  4. `admin-panel/app/website-settings.tsx` (Settings > Website): Optimization settings editor for advance payment (percent, minimum, UPI), pricing rules (night / holiday surcharge, toll estimate per km, minimum fare), extra surcharges (luggage, pet, peak), and referral rewards.
- **Admin App: 360dp Narrow Phone & Dark Mode Layout Overhaul** (eliminated button and field overlapping):
  - `admin-panel/app/create-booking.tsx`: Rebuilt All-Inclusive driver compensation toggle (Standard Tariff vs Package Amount) with responsive chip pills and clean tariff cards.
  - `admin-panel/app/fleet-subscriptions.tsx`: Replaced squished payment channel row with horizontal chip scroll, cleaned up WhatsApp sharing button action rows.
  - `admin-panel/app/fleet-owner-detail.tsx`: Fixed "Upgrade with payment" card layout in Change Partner Tier modal.
  - `admin-panel/app/system-config.tsx`: Fixed PARTNER UPGRADE multiline WhatsApp message input (`minHeight: 90`) and numeric input alignment in Operational Limits.
  - `admin-panel/app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`: Added entries for all new screens, cleaned up subtitle hints with proper line heights.
  - `admin-panel/app/system-health.tsx`: Added confirmation dialogs before running sweep and refreshing cities.
- **Driver App: Linked Unreachable Screens** (`driver-app/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`):
  - Added entry points in Driver Profile menu for `app/documents-review.tsx` (Document Verification Status) and `app/vo-pending-orders.tsx` (Vehicle Owner Pending Orders).
- **Website API: Site Settings Endpoint** (`website/api/admin-app-site-settings.php`):
  - Added secure PHP API with `X-Admin-App-Key` header authentication to safely read and update whitelisted platform settings through `dropcars_save_config_file_or_db` and `sync_settings_to_public_config()`.
- **Validation**:
  - `admin-panel`: `npx tsc --noEmit` -> **0 errors**.
  - `driver-app`: `npx tsc --noEmit` -> **0 errors**.
  - `backend`: `pytest -q tests` -> **219 passed, 0 failed**.
